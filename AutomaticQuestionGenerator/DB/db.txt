for exchange and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Securities exchanged or (B) effecting such withdrawal in compliance with the applicable procedures of
the depositary for the Registrable Securities.  As a condition to participating in the Exchange Offer, a Holder will be
required to represent to the Company and any Guarantor that (i) any Exchange Securities to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) at the time of the commencement of the Exchange Offer it has no
arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act, (iii) it is not an “affiliate”

 The Company and any Guarantor shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided
above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than
that the Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff.  (b) In the event that
(i) the Company and any Guarantor determine that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may not be completed as soon as reasonably practicable after the last Exchange Date because it would
violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason completed on or before the 270th day after the Issue Date (or if such 270th day is not a Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day) or (iii) upon receipt of a written request (a “Shelf Request”) from any Initial Purchaser representing that it holds Registrable Securities that are or were ineligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer,
the Company and any Guarantor shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale of
all the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective.   
-6- 


In the event that the Company and any Guarantor are required to file a Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company and any Guarantor shall use their reasonable best efforts to file and have become effective both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a)
with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the
Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer.  The Company and any Guarantor agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the second anniversary of the Issue Date or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the “Shelf Effectiveness Period”). The Company and any Guarantor further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus if
required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by
a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective, if required, and such Shelf Registration Statement and
Prospectus to become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. Upon the written request of Holders of Registrable Securities, the Company and any Guarantor agree to furnish to such Holders copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after
its being used or filed with the SEC.  (c) The Company and any Guarantor shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such
Holder’s Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.  (d) An Exchange Offer Registration
Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC. A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become
effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.  In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)(ii) hereof, has not become effective on or prior to
the 270th day after the Issue Date (the “Target Registration Date”), the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the Target
Registration Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, in each case until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, becomes effective, up to a
maximum increase of 1.00% per annum. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to any
  
-7- 



particular Registrable Securities, the interest rate borne by the relevant Registrable Securities will be reduced to the original interest rate borne by such Registrable Securities; provided,
however, that, if after any such reduction in interest rate, a different Registration Default occurs, the interest rate borne by the relevant Registrable Securities shall again be increased pursuant to the foregoing provisions.  In the event that the Company receives a Shelf Request pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii), and the Shelf Registration Statement required to
be filed thereby has not become effective by the later of the Target Registration Date and (y) 90 days after delivery of such Shelf Request (such later date, the “Shelf Additional Interest Date”), then the interest rate on the
Registrable Securities will be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period payable commencing from one day after the Shelf Additional Interest Date and (ii) an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each
subsequent 90-day period, in each case until the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, up to a maximum increase of 1.00% per annum.  If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has become effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable, in each case whether or
not permitted by this Agreement, at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 60 days (whether or not consecutive), then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will
be increased by (i) 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period commencing on the 61st day after such Shelf Registration Statement cease to be effective or the Prospectus ceases to be useable and (ii) an additional 0.25% per
annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, up to a maximum increase of 1.00% per annum, in each case until and ending on such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again become effective or the Prospectus again becomes
usable.  (e) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and any Guarantor
acknowledge that any failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is
no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce
the Company’s and any Guarantor’s obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.  (f) The Company
represents, warrants and covenants that it (including its agents and representatives) will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any Free Writing Prospectus.  3. Registration Procedures.  (a) In connection with their obligations pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof, the Company and any Guarantor shall as expeditiously as possible:  (i) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on the appropriate form under the Securities Act, which form
(x) shall be selected by the Company and any Guarantor (y) shall, in the case of a Shelf Registration, be available for the sale of the

Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof and (z) shall comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the applicable form and include all financial statements

Guarantor consent to the use of such Prospectus, preliminary prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with applicable law by each of the Holders of Registrable Securities and any such Underwriters in connection with the
offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by and in the manner described in such Prospectus, preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with applicable law;  (iv) use their commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Securities under all applicable state
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement shall reasonably request in writing by the time the applicable Registration Statement becomes effective; cooperate with
such Holders in connection with any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.; and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each Holder to complete the

securities in any such jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to so qualify, (2) file any general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction or (3) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not
so subject;  (v) notify counsel for the Initial Purchasers and, in the case of a Shelf Registration, notify

notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, (5) of the happening of any event during the period a Registration

such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and any Guarantor may from time to time reasonably request in writing.  (c) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder of Registrable Securities covered in such Shelf Registration Statement agrees
that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and any Guarantor of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(v)(3) or 3(a)(v)(5) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(ix) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and any Guarantor such Holder will
deliver to the Company and any Guarantor all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder’s possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such
notice.  (d) If the Company and any Guarantor shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and any Guarantor shall extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including
the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. Such suspensions shall not
exceed 45 days in any three-month period or 90 days in any twelve-month period.  (e) The Holders of Registrable Securities
covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager or managers (each an
“Underwriter”) that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.  4. Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer.  (a) The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer
as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a “Participating Broker-Dealer”) may be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of
the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.   
-13- 


The Company and any Guarantor understand that it is the Staff’s position that if the
Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the
Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their
prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.  (b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and any Guarantor agree to amend or
supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement), in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and any Guarantor further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall
be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.  (c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may
make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.  5. Indemnification and Contribution.  (a) The Company and any Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their
respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred promptly following receipt
of a request therefor), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any Free Writing
Prospectus used in violation of this Agreement or any “issuer information” (“Issuer Information”) filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are
based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in
writing through JPMorgan or any selling Holder, respectively expressly for use therein. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company and any
  
-14- 



Guarantor, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their
respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with
any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.  (b) Each Holder agrees,
severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, any Guarantor the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors of the Company and any Guarantor, each officer of the Company and any Guarantor who signed the
Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Guarantor, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the
same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission
made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement and any Prospectus.  (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted
against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the “Indemnified Person”) shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be
sought (the “Indemnifying Person”) in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been
materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an
Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and
expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the
Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as
  
-15- 



they are incurred. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in
writing by JPMorgan, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The
Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each
Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the
Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more
than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person
shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder
by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject
matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.  (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or
insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and any Guarantor from the offering of the Securities and
the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and any Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection
with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and any Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and any Guarantor
or by the Holders and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  (e) The Company, any Guarantor and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d)
  
-16- 



above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.  (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. 
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect
regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or
any Guarantor or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or any Guarantor, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration
Statement.  6. General.  (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company and any Guarantor represent, warrant and agree that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not
inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor under any other agreement and (ii) neither the Company nor any Guarantor has entered into, or on or
after the date of this Agreement will enter into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.  (b) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified
or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company and any Guarantor have obtained the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Registrable Securities affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent; provided that no amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent to any departure from the provisions of Section 5 hereof
shall be effective as against any Holder of Registrable Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates
exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Registrable Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose Registrable Securities are not being tendered
pursuant to such
  
-17- 



Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Registrable Securities subject to such Exchange Offer. Any amendments, modifications, supplements,
waivers or consents pursuant to this Section 6(b) shall be by a writing executed by each of the parties hereto.  (c)
Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, telex, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (i) if to a
Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the Company by means of a notice given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c), which address initially is, with respect to the Initial Purchasers, the address set forth
in the Purchase Agreement; (ii) if to the Company and any Guarantor, initially at the Company’s address set forth in the Purchase Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 6(c); and (iii) to such other persons at their respective addresses as provided in the Purchase Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 6(c). All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered
back, if telexed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next Business Day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be concurrently
delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee, at the address specified in the Indenture.  (d) Successors and
Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders;
provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire
Registrable Securities in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall be
conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof. The Initial Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers)
shall have no liability or obligation to the Company or any Guarantor with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement.  (e) Third Party Beneficiaries. Each Holder shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder between the Company
and any Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of
other Holders hereunder.  (f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   
-18- 


(g) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only,
are not a part of this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.  (h) Governing Law. This
Agreement, and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in
the application of any laws other than the laws of the State of New York.  (j) Entire Agreement; Severability. This
Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all oral statements and prior writings with respect thereto. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable or against public policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated. The Company, any Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which becomes
as close as possible to that of the invalid, void or unenforceable provisions.
